    "The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it." --Robert Swan
    <br>
    I'm a hardened commuter, musician, and a computer enthusiast!
    I read National Geographics two at a time. (Not sure why.)
    Sometimes I mistake computer code for poetry, because of the way it lines up neatly on the page. (Yay indents!)
    I also believe that poking at problems can lead to good things, and this blog is a compilation of cool problems.
    My interests include: singing, computational sustainability, renewable energy,
    green computing, databases, neural networks, probabilistic programming, martial arts, graphics, watermelons,
    complexity theory, math, music (all kinds!), puzzles, and biking!
    When I grow up my eventual goal is to do artificial intelligence for an environmental organization, work on 
    the energy grid, work for the Peace Corps, study cryptography, sing,
    or to do something related to biking and/or fluid mechanics!

    Quick explanation of projects: <br>
      BrainExplorer is a graphics project developed to educate people about how the brain works! It's interactive and the
      in Pt. 2, if audio is turned on, my voice will explain how different phenomena in the brain occur (like how your brain
      works when you're catching a baseball).
      It took a while and a lot of Stack Overflow searching
      to code, but it was pretty fun :). The languages it uses are: JavaScript, WebGL, HTML, CSS.

    Other projects I have yet to opensource: <br>
      A neural network which uses the Million Song Dataset to classify music. This is my most recent one, and I'll revise it
      and opensource it once I can get it to classify audio. Languages: Python (although I started it in C++). <br>
      An Arduino device which monitors temperature of sick people and connects to an Android app which then calls an emergency
      number when the temperature reaches a dangerous level. Languages: Arduino, Android Studio. Can't opensource because hardware.
