  Genetic Algorithm to solve the Knapsack Problem
      (Repost from nanditanaik.wordpress.com)
      The knapsack problem is in optimization: given a set of N items, each with a weight and a value, what is the optimal subset of them which keeps the total weight under a fixed number and maximizes the total value? The name refers to a common problem in packing luggage, and this problem appears in a lot of different fields like cryptography and investments and portfolios.

<br><br. There are three types of the knapsack problem. <br> The most common is the 0-1, where only one of each item in the set is provided. In this, the total number of subsets would be 2^n, and you must choose the optimal subset whose weight is under a value and whose total value is maximal.

<br>Another is the bounded knapsack problem, where the quantities of each item can be more than 1, but are restricted to a given value c. There is also an unbounded knapsack problem, where there is no upper limit on how much of an item can be in the knapsack. Both these problems have the same objective: maximize value, keep weight under a fixed value.

<br>There is a particularly interesting solution to the 0-1 problem called the genetic algorithm. This optimization algorithm is inspired by evolution. Basically, the “population” is a random initialization of problem solutions. A fitness function evaluates the quality of the individuals, and then a parent selection takes place. Then the offspring is “mutated”.

<br> How can this solve the 0-1 knapsack problem? We can represent every possible solution with a binary string. Then we pick two at random out of the population, and choose the better one. This one will generate offspring, and a random calculation will determine whether the offspring is mutated. Then survivors are selected. This algorithm terminates if there was no improvement over the last 25 generations.</div>

    On Zero-Knowledge Proofs

In the world of elementary school, or at least my elementary school, friendships were forged and broken by the trust-fall test. Basically, you'd fall backwards onto the person and if the person caught you, they were trustworthy. Else they'd step aside and let you fall. Which happened to me a grand total of three times.

In this scenario, the person who you're falling onto has some information that you do not: whether they're going to catch you. All this up till now has been about you not trusting the person, but what if your fellow kindergartener doesn't trust you, and also doesn't want you to gain any extra information?

This is an example of an interactive proof system, where you have two parties: the Prover, and the Verifier. The Prover wants to convince the Verifier that a mathematical statement is true (namely that he trusts you), or at least has a trivially low probability of being wrong. You are the Verifier, and the person you fall onto is the Prover. What if you can't trust the Prover? Or, more oddly, what if the Prover doesn't trust you?

The five-year-old that you then fell onto might use something called a zero-knowledge proof. It's purpose is to minimize information leakage. After the prover has made his proof to you, you will know something is right but you will not have gained any extra information from the process of the proof.

Look here for an example: http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer.html.

How might such a proof work in this case? Is a zero-knowledge proof even possible? (I'm not quite sure.)

Updates in a week!

  "The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it."
--Robert Swan

On most days, reading the National Geographic causes my stomach to do various gymnastics moves that I couldn't do in real life. Backflips. Hurkeys. Various flip-turns. (sorry, that's swimming)

Today I read last year's issue, September 2015. It was about implanting a GPS chip in a fake ivory tusk which was then tracked all around the Ivory Road through nature reserves in Africa.

My inner ninja is thiiiiiis close to flipping out.

Ivory trade.

Two little words, but they're backed up by complicated terrorist systems and have the potential to disrupt a whole lot of other systems.

Fighting wildlife crime through tech would involve not just fighting the terrorist systems, but also trying to balance the ecological system within nature reserves AND saving the villages near these reserves, which are often plagued by terrorist attacks.

Ivory is basically really expensive currency, bought in China, Kenya, Sudan, Laos, and a lot of countries in the Eastern Hemisphere and possibly the Western, too. I wish people didn't crave forbidden items so much.
