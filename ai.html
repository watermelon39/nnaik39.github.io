  How do we make machines understand music the way we do?

  <strong>Level 1: Recommendation Systems</strong>
  <br>
  Suppose you're a computer working for Spotify. The user is listening to a specific song, maybe "Grenade" by Bruno Mars.
  <br>
  Now, I want you to figure out five recommendations to give to the user. There are a ton of ways you could do this. Right now,
  many recommendation systems look at multiple other users who also listened to "Grenade", and looked at the songs they consumed
  right after that. Then it makes recommendations based on those other songs.
  While that may work, what about looking into the actual music itself and finding musical similarities between songs? The user
  may be quite inclined to like songs of a similar rhythm, in a similar key, etc...
  <br>
  This is an example of a central question in a field called music information retrieval, which is focused on extracting
  data from audio signals.
